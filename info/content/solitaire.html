            <h1>Solitaire</h1>
            <p><strong>Coming Attractions</strong></p>
            <p>Content warning: Suicide mention, body horror and abstracted gore, satanic cult imagery, conspiracy to murder, multiple instances of harassment, and skiing accidents.
            As always, I have to note that any list cannot accurately describe how elements work in context! This is a fun little show.
            </p><p>
            The majority of this episode is abstracted enough to make it difficult to define while still allowing it to remain open.
            This is a story that utilizes conspiracy theories, based on baseless accounts of mind control.
            It's an extension of the real underlying fears and dynamics that play a single part in perpetuating moral panics. It's really about other things.
            </p>Know your limits and take care.
